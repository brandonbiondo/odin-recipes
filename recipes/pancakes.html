  <h3>Homemade pancakes are a beloved breakfast treat enjoyed by people around the world. They are fluffy, light, and customizable with various toppings and syrups.</h3>
  <h3>Here's a simple recipe for homemade pancakes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons melted butter (plus extra for greasing the pan)</li>
    <li>Optional toppings: maple syrup, fresh fruits, chocolate chips, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt until well combined.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter until well blended.</li>
    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps in the batter. Overmixing can lead to dense pancakes.</li>
    <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Grease the surface with a small amount of butter or cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Using a ladle or a measuring cup, pour about 1/4 cup of the pancake batter onto the hot skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, and the edges start to look set, usually about 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Flip the pancakes using a spatula and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Serve the pancakes hot with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, chocolate chips, or whipped cream.</li>
  </ol>
